### What is FreeSeal?
FreeSeal is a free, open-source fork of DocuSeal that restores **most premium features** removed from the official open-source version. I have:

- 🗝️ **Unlocked** paywalled enterprise features  
- 🔓 **Removed** proprietary restrictions  
- 🛠️ **Maintained** core functionality  
- 🌍 **Kept** it 100% open-source  

### Why FreeSeal Exists  
I need a solution for document signing tools that should be accessible to everyone. When DocuSeal locked essential features behind paywalls, i decided to code back atleast a few of the functionalities i missed.
